# NOAA-Case-Study

1. Does Temperature, sunshine, humidity and air pressure predict rainfall in the Denver Area

2. Does Temperature, sunshine, humidity and air pressure predict rainfall after controlling for seasonality and region in the Denver Area

3. If Temperature, sunshine, humidity and air pressure does predict rainfall which predictor is the most significant.

# Accomplished Tuesday

1. Actually got my data (BIG DEAL)

2. cleaned up data (mostly recoding object vars that were actually numeric varcs)

3. performed some eda: cor matrix, point-biserial for each continuous var

4. ran logistic regression

# Roadmap

1. compare to baseline model and model with extra lag variables so model can see further in past

...

...

2. use final model to get metrics on testing data

3. compare final model to data from a completely different station
    - does model fit data specific station or is it more generalizable?
